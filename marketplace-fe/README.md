# Gator Marketplace FE

This project contains the frontend code for Gator Marketplace, built with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.4.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.x or later)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/cli) (v19.1.4 or later)
- A package manager like npm or yarn

## Installing Dependencies

Before running the application, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Server

To start the local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload when you modify any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Generate Angular components, directives, pipes, and other schematics with the following command:

```bash
ng generate <schematic> <name>
```

For example, to generate a new component:

```bash
ng generate component my-component
```

To see all available schematics:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building the Project

To build the project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

```bash
ng build --prod
```

This will compile the project and place the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, a production build optimizes for performance and speed. To perform a production build, use:


## Running Unit Tests

Execute unit tests using the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Note: Angular CLI does not include an e2e framework by default. Install and configure one, such as [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [Protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/), if needed.

## Linting

Run linting checks to ensure code quality and adherence to style guidelines:

```bash
ng lint
```
